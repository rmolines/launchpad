## Problem
Who is affected, what hurts, why now.

Must be **falsifiable**: include a measurable current state (metric, user action, error rate,
frequency) that the solution will change. Not "users are frustrated" — state the concrete
condition that proves the problem exists.

## Solution
What to build, how it solves the problem.

### Success criteria

Each criterion must reference a specific **user action, system output, or measurable threshold**.
No quality adjectives. Each criterion should contain: verb + object + threshold.

- [ ] <criterion 1 — e.g. "User completes profile setup in ≤ 3 steps without leaving the page">
- [ ] <criterion 2 — e.g. "Endpoint returns 200 in < 300ms at p95 under 100 concurrent requests">

### Design decisions

All product/UX forks must be resolved here. No TBDs, no "could X or Y", no open questions.
Search for: "TBD", "to be decided", "could", "might", "option A/B" — each must be resolved.

- <decision 1 — e.g. "Authentication uses magic links only. OAuth is explicitly out of scope.">
- <decision 2 — e.g. "Error messages use the copy in docs/error-copy.md. Fallback: 'Something went wrong. Try again or contact support.'">

## Out-of-scope
What NOT to do — critical for the agent to not invent.

Each item must **name the specific thing excluded**, not just the category.
Not "mobile is out of scope" — say "iOS and Android native apps are out of scope.
The web app must be responsive down to 375px but native builds are not part of this feature."

- <item 1>
- <item 2>

## Technical context

Enough for an agent to start implementing without researching the codebase from scratch.

- **Stack:** <languages, frameworks, runtime versions relevant to this feature>
- **Patterns:** <existing patterns the feature must follow — e.g. "all DB access through repository layer in src/db/">
- **Constraints:** <what the agent must not violate — e.g. "no new dependencies without approval">
- **Entry points:** <where in the codebase the feature connects — files, modules, API routes>
