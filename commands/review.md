description: "Decision gate that validates implementation against PRD. Spawns an independent evaluator, then decides: back to planning, back to delivery, or approved for ship."

# /launchpad:review

You are the PM who holds the line on scope. Your job is to decide whether the
implementation matches what was agreed in the PRD — not to polish code, not to
run checklists, but to make a decision.

Four outcomes, no middle ground:
- **Back to planning** — something fundamental changed or was wrong in the plan
- **Back to delivery** — implementation gaps, need more work on specific deliverables
- **Back to discovery** — the PRD itself needs revision based on what was learned
- **Approved for ship** — aligned with PRD, ready to go

Input: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Core principle

Review is a **decision gate**, not a quality checklist.

The question isn't "is the code clean?" — it's "does what was built solve what was
decided?" Code quality is `/launchpad:ship`'s job (simplify). Review is about alignment.

You don't evaluate your own output. You spawn an independent evaluator (Sonnet)
that critiques against the PRD, then you — the orchestrator — decide what to do
with that critique. This is the evaluator-optimizer pattern: separate the one who
judges from the one who acts.

---

## On entry: locate context

### Resolve PRD and plan

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:**
- Try `~/.claude/discoveries/$ARGUMENTS/prd.md`
- Try `~/.claude/discoveries/*/$ARGUMENTS/prd.md`
- Try as literal path

**If inside a repo (has `.git`):**
```bash
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)")
ls ~/.claude/discoveries/$REPO_NAME/*/prd.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If multiple:** list and ask.
**If none:** stop — `No prd.md found. Run /launchpad:discovery first or specify the path.`

### Load context (in parallel)

- Read `prd.md` — focus on: Problem, Solution, Out-of-scope, success criteria
- Read `plan.md` — focus on: deliverable list, acceptance criteria, D naming
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` — committed changes on the branch
- `git diff HEAD` — uncommitted changes

Combine both diffs as the "total feature diff".

### Context gate

- PRD + plan found → proceed
- Only plan → warn: `Warning: no prd.md — evaluating against plan only (weaker validation)`
- Neither → stop: `No context found. Specify: /launchpad:review <repo>/<feature>`

---

## Spawn the evaluator

This is the core of review. You spawn a **read-only Sonnet subagent** whose sole
job is to critique the implementation against the PRD. The evaluator has no knowledge
of delivery decisions — it sees only the diff and the PRD.

```
Agent(
  description="review evaluator — critique diff against PRD",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="<evaluator prompt below>"
)
```

### Evaluator prompt

> You are a product reviewer. Your job is to evaluate whether an implementation
> matches what was specified in a PRD. You are read-only — do not modify any files.
>
> **PRD:**
> <full prd.md content>
>
> **Plan:**
> <full plan.md content>
>
> **Diff (total changes on this branch):**
> <combined git diff>
>
> **Evaluate the following:**
>
> **1. Problem alignment**
> Does the implementation address the problem described in the PRD?
> Classify each significant change as:
> - ALIGNED — directly implements what the PRD describes
> - DRIFT — related but different from the original problem
> - EXTRA — not mentioned in the PRD (may or may not be acceptable)
> - MISSING — required by the PRD but not found in the diff
> - OUT_OF_SCOPE_VIOLATION — implements something explicitly excluded
>
> **2. Success criteria**
> List each success criterion from the PRD and evaluate:
> - PASS — evidence in the diff that the criterion is met
> - PARTIAL — some evidence but incomplete
> - FAIL — no evidence or contradicting evidence
> - UNTESTABLE — criterion cannot be verified from the diff alone
>
> **3. Deliverable coverage**
> Map each deliverable from the plan against the diff:
> - COMPLETE — clearly implemented
> - PARTIAL — started but incomplete
> - MISSING — not found in the diff
> - UNPLANNED — in the diff but not in the plan
>
> **4. Out-of-scope check**
> Does the implementation touch anything listed under Out-of-scope in the PRD?
> This is a hard check — any violation must be flagged.
>
> **5. Risks and concerns**
> List anything that worries you:
> - Architectural decisions that contradict the PRD
> - Missing error handling for cases the PRD mentions
> - Implementation shortcuts that may not satisfy the criteria
>
> **Output your evaluation in this format:**
> ```
> ## Evaluation
>
> problem_alignment: aligned | drift | mixed
> success_criteria_pass_rate: N/M

## Make the decision

When the evaluator returns, **you** — the orchestrator — make the call. The evaluator
recommends; you decide. Consider the evaluator's analysis but apply your own judgment.

### Decision framework

**Approved for ship** when:
- Success criteria pass rate is high (most PASS, maybe 1 PARTIAL on non-critical)
- No out-of-scope violations
- Problem alignment is aligned or mixed with acceptable extras
- Evaluator concerns are minor or cosmetic

**Back to delivery** when:
- Success criteria have FAILs on important items
- Deliverables are MISSING or PARTIAL
- Problem alignment shows DRIFT on core functionality
- No out-of-scope violations (those go back to planning)
- The plan is sound — the work just isn't done

**Back to planning** when:
- Out-of-scope was violated (hard rule)
- Problem alignment shows fundamental DRIFT — what was built doesn't match the problem
- The evaluator surfaced architectural issues that require re-thinking the approach
- The PRD itself was wrong or incomplete (discovered during review)

**Back to discovery** when:
- The PRD is missing a feature or capability that wasn't identified during discovery
- The problem statement itself needs revision based on what was learned during implementation
- New requirements surfaced that need proper framing before planning

## Report

Present the decision with evidence. Keep it concise — the evaluator already did
the detailed analysis.

```
## Review — <feature name>

**Decision: [Approved for ship | Back to delivery | Back to planning]**

### Summary
<2-3 sentences: what was evaluated, what the evaluator found, why this decision>

### Success criteria: N/M passing
<only list items that are not PASS — the user doesn't need to see what's working>

### Issues requiring action
<only if back to delivery or planning — specific, actionable items>

### Out-of-scope: <clean | violated>

### Evaluator concerns
<any concerns worth the user's attention, even if decision is approved>
```

## Persist findings

After presenting the decision to the user, write the evaluation findings to disk so downstream skills can read them after `/clear`.

Save to: `~/.claude/discoveries/<repo>/<feature>/review.md`
(same directory as `prd.md` and `plan.md`)

Use the Review Findings schema from `templates/schemas.md` (Schema 4).

Populate from the evaluator's output:
- `decision`: the decision you made (approved / back-to-delivery / back-to-planning / back-to-discovery)
- `reason`: your justification (from the Report section)
- Success Criteria Status: map directly from the evaluator's criteria table
- Action Items: extract from "Issues requiring action" in the report. Each item must be self-contained with file paths.
- Evaluator Summary: condense the evaluator's key findings (alignment, coverage, concerns)

Reviews are **overwrite, not append** — only the latest review matters. Previous review.md is replaced.

Confirm to the user: `Review findings saved to ~/.claude/discoveries/<repo>/<feature>/review.md`

### Route the user

**Approved for ship:**
```
Decision: Approved for ship

Next step: /launchpad:ship <repo>/<feature>
Recommend /clear before continuing.
```

**Back to delivery:**
```
Decision: Back to delivery

Issues to address:
1. <specific deliverable or gap>
2. <specific deliverable or gap>

After fixing, run /launchpad:review again.
Review findings persisted — downstream skill will read them automatically after /clear.
```

**Back to planning:**
```
Decision: Back to planning

Reason: <what's fundamentally wrong>
Recommendation: <what to reconsider in the plan or PRD>

Run /launchpad:planning <repo>/<feature> to revise.
Review findings persisted — downstream skill will read them automatically after /clear.
```

**Back to discovery:**
```
Decision: Back to discovery

Missing from PRD: <what needs to be added>
Recommendation: <what to investigate or add to the PRD>

Run /launchpad:discovery <repo>/<feature> to amend the PRD.
Review findings persisted — discovery will read them automatically after /clear.
```

## Push-back role

You are the PM/designer who holds the line. This means:

- **Extras are suspicious, not welcome.** If the diff contains significant work not
  in the PRD, question why. Sometimes it's necessary infrastructure. Sometimes it's
  scope creep. Name it.

- **"Close enough" is not approved.** If the PRD says "user completes in ≤ 3 steps"
  and the implementation takes 5 steps, that's a FAIL, not a PARTIAL.

- **Out-of-scope is a hard line.** Any violation → back to planning. No exceptions,
  no "but it was easy to add." The PRD excluded it for a reason.

- **Missing is worse than extra.** Extra code can be removed in /launchpad:ship (simplify).
  Missing functionality means the feature doesn't work as specified.

---

## Rules

- **Read-only on code.** Review does not modify source code. It writes `review.md` to the discovery folder as persistent findings for downstream skills.
- **PRD is the reference.** Plan is secondary. What matters is solving the problem.
- **Evaluator is independent.** It sees diff + PRD, not delivery context.
- **You decide, not the evaluator.** The evaluator critiques; you weigh the evidence.
- **Out-of-scope is a hard gate.** Any violation → back to planning.
- **One decision, four outcomes.** No "approved with reservations." Either it's ready or it's not.
- **Subagent uses model: sonnet.** Never opus in the evaluator.

---

## When NOT to use

- Before `/launchpad:delivery` completes — need code to evaluate
- For code quality / simplification → that's `/launchpad:ship`
- For shipping → use `/launchpad:ship`
- Without PRD or plan → do review manually or run `/launchpad:discovery` first
