# Launchpad — Agent Notes

## Pitfalls

### Template placeholder strings must not appear in content
Scripts that inject JSON into HTML templates via Python `str.replace()` will break
silently if the placeholder string appears inside the JSON content itself. The result
is malformed JSON, a blank browser page, and exit 0 with no error.

| Script | Placeholder | Content surface |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/plan-view.sh` | `__PLAN_DATA__` | Plan task fields (title, acceptance criteria, files) |
| `scripts/cockpit.sh` | `__COCKPIT_DATA__` | Discovery artifact fields (frontmatter, problem text, plan names, results, review decisions) |

Never use these literal strings in any artifact content, test fixtures, or generated values.

### `status:` frontmatter is stale — derive status from the filesystem
As of domain-model-v2, discovery status is derived from filesystem artifacts by
`scripts/derive-status.sh`, not from the `status:` field in `draft.md` or `prd.md`
frontmatter. Reading `status:` directly will return stale or incorrect data.

- Use `derive_status <discovery_dir>` (source `scripts/derive-status.sh` first).
- `cockpit.sh` already sources it. Any new script that needs status must do the same.
- `ship.md` archives by moving the directory to `archived/`; it no longer patches
  `status: archived` into frontmatter. Do not rely on frontmatter to detect archived state.

### `~/git/cockpit.md` is auto-generated — do not edit it directly
`cockpit.sh --refresh` overwrites `~/git/cockpit.md` entirely via `generate_cockpit_md()`.
Any manual edits to that file are silently lost on the next refresh.

To add manual content to the cockpit use `~/.claude/cockpit-manual.yaml`:
- `needs-attention` — list of `{project, action, type, context}` dicts rendered as a table
- `limbo` — list of project ids excluded from the main listing

### `cockpit-manual.yaml` awk fallback silently drops dict items in `needs-attention`
When PyYAML is unavailable, `cockpit.sh` falls back to an awk parser that only handles
flat string list items (`- some text`). The intended `needs-attention` schema uses dicts:

```yaml
needs-attention:
  - project: foo
    action: Do something
    type: external
    context: path/to/doc.md
```

The awk fallback reads only the first line of each dict entry (`project: foo`) and
discards the remaining keys. The python renderer then calls `item.get('project', '')` on
a plain string, producing an empty table row. Exit code is 0, no error is printed.

Fix: ensure PyYAML is installed (`pip install pyyaml`) so the primary parser runs.
Never use flat string items for `needs-attention` — always use the dict schema above.

### `session_analyzer.py` — `usage` field excludes subagent tokens; `cost` field includes them
`parse_transcript()` returns a dict where `usage` contains only the main session's token
counts (from the root `.jsonl`). Subagent tokens are parsed separately and added to `cost`,
but **not** merged back into `usage`. The display in `format_session_report` adds them
manually for the printed total, and `aggregate_sessions` sums subagent tokens inline.

Any code that reads `parsed["usage"]` directly and derives cost or total tokens from it
will silently under-count. Always use `parsed["cost"]` for cost, and replicate the
`format_session_report` pattern (main usage + iterate `subagent_summaries`) for token
totals.

### `updateStatusCache` writes `status:` to draft.md but `DraftSchema` doesn't declare it
`status.ts` → `updateStatusCache()` reads `draft.md`, sets `doc.data.status = status`,
and writes it back. Every MCP tool that mutates state (create, finalize, add_cycle)
writes a `status:` key into `draft.md` frontmatter.

However, `DraftSchema` has no `status` field. Zod strips unknown keys from validated
output, but `init_update_fields` serializes the merged raw object (not the validated
output), so `status:` persists on disk. Two failure modes:

1. An agent reads `draft.md` frontmatter and trusts `status:` — gets a cached,
   potentially stale value instead of the live filesystem-derived status.
2. `init_update_fields` merges incoming fields over `parsed.data` (which includes
   cached `status:`), validates with Zod (which strips it), but then serializes the
   raw merged object (which retains it).

Rule: never read `status:` from `draft.md` frontmatter. Always call `init_get_status`
or `deriveStatus()`. Do not assume `init_update_fields` strips unknown frontmatter
fields.

### Reading initiatives files — QMD fallback to bash cat
A guard hook blocks `Read`, `Write`, and `Edit` tools on `~/.claude/initiatives/` and
`~/.claude/discoveries/`. The hook directs to QMD tools, but files may not be indexed.

**Strategy (one attempt, then fallback):**
1. Try `qmd.get` with the exact relative path (e.g. `initiatives/fl/feature/plan.md`)
2. If QMD returns "not found" → immediately use `Bash(cat <full-path>)` as fallback
3. Do NOT retry with `multi_get`, `query`, or other QMD search variants — if `qmd.get`
   can't find the file by exact path, search variants won't find it either

This applies to all skills that read from initiatives: delivery, review, planning, ship,
portfolio-review.

### `console.log` corrupts MCP stdio — use `process.stderr.write` exclusively
The MCP server communicates over stdio. Any call to `console.log` writes to stdout,
which interleaves with the MCP protocol stream and causes the client to receive
malformed JSON-RPC messages. The failure is silent: the MCP client drops the message
or disconnects with no useful error.

All logging in this codebase uses `process.stderr.write(...)` directly. Never add
`console.log` calls anywhere under `src/`. For debug output, always use
`process.stderr.write("[tag] message\n")`.

### HTTP API uses `project`/`initiative` — MCP tools use `mission`/`module`
The HTTP API (`src/api/initiatives.ts`) and MCP tools (`src/tools/`) use different
names for the same filesystem concepts:

| Concept | HTTP API field | MCP tool parameter |
|---|---|---|
| Top-level directory under `~/.claude/initiatives/` | `project` | `mission` |
| Subdirectory (feature slug) | `initiative` / `slug` | `module` |

Both layers resolve to the same path: `~/.claude/initiatives/<project>/<slug>/`.
An agent reading MCP tool schemas and then constructing HTTP API calls (or vice versa)
will use the wrong field names and get 404s or empty results with no schema error.

### `parse_requirements` in plan-view.sh silently drops requirements on format mismatch
The awk parser in `scripts/plan-view.sh` only recognises requirement lines matching
exactly `- **R<N>:** <text>`. Any deviation — missing bold markers (`- R1: text`),
bold without trailing colon (`- **R1** text`), or leading whitespace — causes
`parse_requirements` to return empty. The requirements panel in the HTML disappears
silently. The script exits 0. The DAG `requirements:` field still references R-IDs
but nothing links.

Most likely to happen when an agent generates `## Requirements` in plan.md from
scratch instead of copying verbatim from the PRD. Always use the exact format from
`templates/plan-template.md` and `templates/prd-template.md`.
